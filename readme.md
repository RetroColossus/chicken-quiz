# Porfolio Project

  ### This a quiz project where I used setInterval(for a countDown), querySelector, localStorage and an array with objects.  

  ## Code used: HTLM, CSS, and Javascript.

  ## Using a timer:

   * implemented setinterval to countdown the time left to finish the quiz. Also, subtracted time for wrong answers
   

  ## querySelector

   * I used querySelector to target elements in the root HTML document by ID and Class.  I then used textContent and eventListeners to manipulate elements on the screen.
   
  ## localStorage

   * used localStorage to save the users score and name to the DOM.

  ## Array with Objects

   * used an array with ojects to pull questions with answers

  ## CSS

  * simple design for quiz

  ## Javascript

  * used javascript to make quiz interactive thought the DOM
