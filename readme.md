# Quiz Project

  ### This a quiz project where I used setInterval(for a countDown), querySelector, localStorage, and an array.  

  ## Code used: HTLM, CSS, and JavaScript.

  ## About

   * This a timed quiz where you have to finish in 75 seconds. 10 seconds are deducted for every wrong answer.  The final score is the time left at the end of the quiz.
